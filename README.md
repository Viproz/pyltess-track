# pyltess-track

A precise and fast frequency offset estimation for low-cost SDR platforms implemented in python. This impementation can work efficently in embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi, estimating the frequency offset of the internal oscillator in less than 2 seconds.


**pyltess-track** is the open source implementation part of the paper named **LTESS-track: A Precise and Fast Frequency Offset Estimation for low-cost SDR Platforms** published in *ACM Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & CHaracterization (ACM WiNTECH 2017), 16-20 October 2017, Snowbird, Utah, USA* by Roberto Calvo-Palomino, Fabio Ricciato, Domenico Giustiniano and Vincent Lenders ([PDF](http://eprints.networks.imdea.org/id/document/4484))

There is a MATLAB version of pyltess-track available [here](https://github.com/electrosense/LTESS-track)

## Usage

```
$ pyltess-track.py --help
usage: pyltess-track.py [-h] [-s SOURCE] [-f FREQUENCY] [-g GAIN] [-t TIME]
                        [-j JSON] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        Set default SDR source device to use (default: -1)
  -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                        Set LTE center frequency of the channel (Hz) (default:
                        806000000.0)
  -g GAIN, --gain GAIN  Gain (default: 30)
  -t TIME, --time TIME  Seconds collecting data on LTE frequency (default: 1)
  -j JSON, --json-file JSON
                        Set the json file where results will be written
                        (default: None)
  -d, --debug           enable debug mode with plots (default: False)
```

## Running

**pyltess-track** makes use of the PSS (Primary Synchronization Signal) of LTE to estimate the FOC. Make sure that you tune properly to the center frequency of LTE signal. Tipically following frequencies will work: 796 MHz, 806 MHz and 816 MHz.
